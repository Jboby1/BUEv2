			<p class="classname">General</p>
			<p class="pos">Added several promotional cosmetics and weapons (such as the Bolt-Action Blitzer, Black Rose, Iron Curtain, Big Kill, Ect.) to the drop pool, as the games they could be achieved from have shut down.</p>
			<p class="neu">Copies of these items obtained before this update are now Genuine quality, and tradable</p>
			<br>
			<p class="neu">Most laser weapons (The Grordbort packs, plus The Batsaber and the Shooting Star) now deal fire damage instead of their original respective damage types</p>
			<p class="neu">This change does not allow them to deal afterburn</p>
			<br>
			<p class="pos">Revamped inventory system with new options including multi-select, mass deletion, search, and additional/smarter auto-sort options</p>
			<br>
			<p class="pos">Added "New Zealium" weapons, which can be obtained from a brand-new Chemistry Set by inputting 200 Refined Metal and a class or slot token</p>
			<p class="neu">Strangeifiers for these weapons can be crafted at any time, by inputting 100 Refined Metal and either a Civilian Grade Stat Clock or a pre-existing Strange weapon</p>
			<br>
			<p class="pos">Reintroduced Collector's quality Chemistry Sets, and expanded the pool of collectable items to include all new and pre-existing weapons and cosmetics</p>
			<p class="pos">A very rare "Mechanic-Type" Chemistry Set has also been added, which accepts tools, paints, crates and keys-- outputs are unusable, but come with a special description!</p>
